# this will fix the permits for git using sshkeys in a remote vps with a local user.

sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
sudo chown -R ${USER} ~/.ssh/
sudo chgrp -R ${USER} ~/.ssh/

# Explanation
#
#
# sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh/:

# sudo: This command is used to execute the following command with superuser privileges, allowing you to modify system files and settings.
# chmod: This command is used to change file or directory permissions.
# 700: The argument 700 sets the permissions for the ~/.ssh/ directory. In this case, it grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner of the directory (you), and no permissions to anyone else. These permissions are represented as 7 for the owner, 0 for the group, and 0 for others. It ensures that only the owner has full control over the directory, which is essential for SSH security.
# 600: The argument 600 sets the permissions for all files inside the ~/.ssh/ directory. It grants read and write permissions only to the owner (you) and no permissions to the group or others. This ensures that the contents of the ~/.ssh/ directory are only accessible and modifiable by the owner.

# ${USER}: This is a shell variable that typically represents the current user's username. It's used here to set the owner of the ~/.ssh/ directory to the current user, ensuring that you have full ownership and control over your SSH configuration files.
# chgrp: This command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.
# -R: The -R flag indicates that the operation should be performed recursively, affecting all files and subdirectories within ~/.ssh/.
