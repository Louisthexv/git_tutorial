sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*
sudo chown -R ${USER} ~/.ssh/
sudo chgrp -R ${USER} ~/.ssh/

# Explanation
#
#
# sudo chmod 700 ~/.ssh/:

# sudo: This command is used to execute the following command with superuser privileges, allowing you to modify system files and settings.
# chmod: This command is used to change file or directory permissions.
# 700: The argument 700 sets the permissions for the ~/.ssh/ directory. In this case, it grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner of the directory (you), and no permissions to anyone else. These permissions are represented as 7 for the owner, 0 for the group, and 0 for others. It ensures that only the owner has full control over the directory, which is essential for SSH security.
